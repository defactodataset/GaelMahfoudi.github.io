# Introduction

Digital image forensic has gained a lot of attention as it is becoming easier for anyone to make forged images. Several areas are concerned by image manipulation: a doctored image can increase the credibility of fake news, impostors can use morphed images to pretend being someone else. 

It became of critical importance to be able to recognize the manipulations suffered by the images. To do this, the first need is to be able to rely on reliable and controlled data sets representing the most characteristic cases encountered. The purpose of this work is to lay the foundations of a body of tests allowing both the qualification of automatic methods of authentication and detection of manipulations and the training of these methods.

Various techniques are involved in image manipulations, from simple global characteristics improvements (color enhancement, saturation, color remapping, contrast increase) to complex local forgeries (object incrustation or deletion, camouflage in-painting, morphing of structure)
